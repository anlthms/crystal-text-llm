  <figcaption> We show that finetuned LLMs can be used to generate stable materials using string encodings. These finetuned LLMs can match or exceed the performance of a domain specific diffusion model (CDVAE). LLMs can also be used to mutate existing materials or to sample crystal structures conditioned on text descriptions. </figcaption>

‚ö†Ô∏è Our method resembles but is not the same as CrystaLLM (https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04340), which explores training language models from scratch on CIF-formatted crystals. You can find the code associated with that project at the following link: https://github.com/lantunes/CrystaLLM. ‚ö†Ô∏è

## üõ† Installation
Run the following command to install all dependencies. 
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üöÄ Training and Sampling Models
Run training with
```
python llama_finetune.py --run-name 7b-test-run --model 7b
```
and sample from a PEFT model with
```
python llama_sample.py --model_name 7b --model_path=exp/7b-test-run/checkpoint-500 --out_path=llm_samples.csv
```

If you are using Llama-3.2 use the scripts inside the [scripts](scripts) subdirectory.

## E above hull evaluation

To construct the convex hull, you must download structure entries from the following link:
https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Matbench_Discovery_v1_0_0/22715158

Then energy values can be computed with
```
python e_above_hull.py --structures_fn [CSV FILE WITH STRUCTURES] --entries_fn [PATH TO STRUCTURE ENTRIES .json.gz FILE]
```
